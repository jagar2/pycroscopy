============
Load Dataset
============

Conventionally, the h5py package is used to create, read, write, and modify h5 files.

Pycroscopy uses h5py to read hdf5 files and the ioHDF5 subpackage (a light wrapper around h5py) within pycroscopy
to create / write back to the file. Please see the example on writing hdf5 files for more information on creating and
writing to h5 files using pycroscopy.

In the event that modification / addition of data to the existing file is of interest,
it is recommended that the file be opened using ioHDF5. The same h5py handles can be obtained easily from ioHDF5.
Note that ioHDF5 always reads the files in the 'r+' mode that allows modification of the file.

In this example, we will be loading the Raw_Data dataset from the hdf5 file.
